# raid-static-data-parser

NOTE: If you're just interested in the champion and ability data, see this: https://bit.ly/34c6vb7

Contains a Python 3 script that imports the Raid Static Data .json file and does various helpful and as-of-yet-vaguely-specified things, including but eventually not limited to:

- Outputting a .csv file with expected rewards from various Campaign stages and stats on energy efficiency for each stage and difficulty
- Outputting a .csv file with in-depth info on Champions, their stats, their ability descriptions/effects/multipliers, their skill upgrades from books, and more
